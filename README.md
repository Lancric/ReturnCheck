## ReturnCheck

There are many other ReturnChecks around for ROBLOX, like [Eternal's ReturnCheck Bypass](https://eternalv3.github.io/Retcheck/), and [Variable's ReturnCheck Bypass](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=148727), This isn't an 'expert' way of Bypassing this Check. 

______________________________________________
 #ReturnCheck
 ReturnCheck, also commonly known as 'Retcheck' is a Check added to 'improve ROBLOX's Security' (Totally not working well with that 'SECURITY'). As some of you might know, ROBLOX uses an 'edited' version of Lua5.1. They have installed this 'Check' in ***many***(almost all) of the LuaC API Functions (lua_getfield, lua_pcall, etc.). And being that stupid guy you are you want to bypass this Check without causing a massive pain in the but, triggering the unstoppable beast called the 'Integrity Checker'
 
 ____________________________________________
 #Integrity Checker
 This check is also like 'Retcheck', there is a more-common name for this Check, and it is 'The BIG HULK' (jks). No, it's called the Memory Checker. This checker is probably the most hardest to bypass. It scans for certain parts, maybe all to check if there had been any 'Memory Modifications' hence the name Memory Check.
